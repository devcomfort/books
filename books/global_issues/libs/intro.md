## Basic Informations

Hello and welcome to this class! Here is some basic information: <br>
My name is _Nelson Parish_. Please call me "Nelson" or "Mr. Parish". <br>
Please don't call me "Parish".

Contact: <br>
Please email me with questions about the class, your grades/attendance, etc. <br>
I'm at [anparoikos@gmail.com](mailto:anparoikos@gmail.com). You can also leave messages for me on E-class, but I don't check that as often. and sometimes the messages appear hours after you've left them. <br>
If you have a simple question, you can also call me at [010-2867-0341](tel:01028670341). If I don't answer, please send me a text. I'm also on _What's App_ and _KakaoTalk_.

<font color="red">
Note: I generally have my phone off or on <b>"Do Not Distrub"</b> mode from 10:00 PM to 9:00 AM. If you call or text too late or too early, I probably won't answer your message very quickly. Please plan ahead if you have questions about homework, quizzes, tests, etc.

## Materials Informations

### About _Calendar_ and _Lecture Resources_

Good news! You don't have to buy a book for this class! Instead, I will bring materials to class and/or put them on E-Class for you to download before each class. Every week, before tou come to class, you should check E-Class's "Lecture Resources" section, which is below "Lecture Contents".

I will also put the information we talk about today (in this PPT file) in "Lecture Resources" too. Please check it out if you need to refresh your memory! If you don't understand something, please ask me! It's important information, and I will not excuse students whosay, "I didn't see/understand it!"

Next week (by Friday evening, Sept 9th), go to E-Class's "Calendar" and look at our class schedule. It will show you what I plan to do every day, when homework is due, when tests and holidays are, etc., for the next few weeks. Please look at it weekly, preferably every Thursday night at the latest. I will update and add to it as necessary at least once a week.

### _Lecture Contents_

Even more good news! Global Issues is now a three-credit course! Yay! You get three hours of _Mr. Parish_ per week instead of the traditional two hours!

Sadly, you will not see me in the classroom for three hours a week, so you'll just have to go home and stare at this picture instead.

We will meet for two hours every Friday. The other hour is a 25-minute lecture you'll have to watch every week. At the end of the pre-recorded Zoom lecture is an assignment. On average, each assignment will take at least 50 minutes, and probably more. You will have to complete seven (7) of the 14 assignments I give you this semester.

> **Important!** <br>
> Whether or not you do an assignment for a lecture, you must still watch the lecture! If you don't, E-class will automatically count you absent.
>
> I will put a weekly Zoom lecture on E-Class "Lecture Contents" every Friday morning at the latest. You will have about a week to watch the assignment from the "Assignments" section and turn in your assignment.

As the semester goes on, I might have to change attendance policy or exceptions for students in special situations. If you have a special situations, please tell me as soon as you can. After you get your final grade at the end of the semester, it's too late to tell me! Let's try to solve our problems early when it's easier. Keep me informed!

### Participation / Learning Attitude (20%)

This is a discussion class, so we will do a lot of speaking activities. I expect you to participate actively when I ask you to. It's also important because I think you'll learn a lot more by talking to your classmates than you will by listening to me!

In almost every class hour, I will assign each of you from 0 to 3 participation points. <br>
Most students who get A+, A, and B+ grades are active in class, too.

### Homework (10%) - Pre-Recorded Lecture Assignments

I will give you 14 homework (AKA "HW") assignments this semester. You choose seven (7) of them. Please do al seven assignmetns! <br>
Students who skip one or two assignments ofteh get C's, and those who those who skip more often get D's or F's. <br>

You **CANNOT** do eight or more assignments to get extra points or replace a bad HW grade. <br>
Be sure you try hard on each assignment. If an assignment is too difficult or boring, or if you're too busy to do it that week, then wait for other assignments.

I don't have time to regrade poorly done assignments, but I am happy to answer questions about your HW as you're doing it! <br>
Your first HW assignment is already online! Watch the pre-recorded Zoom video in E-Class's _"Lecture Contents"_. You can do the assignment at the end of the lesson if you want to. It's due via email by 11:59 PM on Friday, Sept 9th.

### Quizzes (10%)

I hope there will be two written quizzes, each worth 5% of your grade. I will tell you more about the quizzes later as I'm not sure what form they will be yet, but they generally won't take more than 20 minutes.

### Test (50%)

There will be tow written tests. The midterm is worth 20% of your grade, and the final exam is worth 30%. I will give you more information about the exams later.

## Curves 1

I use a standard university curve on all grades in this class except attendance. Thus, for participation, homework, quiz, and test grades, I'll curve the class average to 80%.

For example, if the class average on a test is 70%, the test was too difficult. Everyone's grade wil go up by about 14% (10/70=10%) If the average grade on a test is 90%, the test was too easy. Thus, everyone's test grade will go down by about 11% (10/90=11%) to meet the 80% average.

## Curves 2

DSU usually requires me to use the _absoloute curve_ for this class. That's good news and bad news. The good news is that I can give as many A's, B's, F's, etc., as I want to as long as they are supported by the grading numbers (test scores, quiz scores, etc). I'm not limited to giving, for example, only five A's like I am some of DSU's _relative curve_ couress.

The bad news is that I have less flexibility to _"help"_ you if you are on the borderline between, say, an A and a B+ or and F and a D. Under the relative curve system (0 to 30% A/A+, 0 to 40%, B/B+, etc) that DSU follows for some courses, I can, for example, change th egrade range so that a 58% is a D, not an E. However, under the absoloute curve we'll using, I'm required to follow these grade ranges:

| Score | Rate       |
| ----- | ---------- |
| A+    | 95% ~ 100% |
| A     | 90%~94%    |
| B+    | 85%~89%    |
| C+    | 75%~79%    |
| C     | 70%~74%    |
| D+    | 65%~69%    |
| D     | 60%~64%    |
| F     | 0 ~ 59%    |

Thus, if you don't do homework on time, don't study for tests, etc., and get a 58%, there is _NOTHING_ I can do to help you. I can't change the grade range at all. Don't be one of those sad cases of a student who is lazy and fails this courses by a more 2%! Study hard! Do your homework! Keep up with the class!

## Warning!

Every semester that I've taught this course, the same thing has happend. A student is not diligent, doesn't do homework, misses quizzes, etc. Then, they see their final grade and are disappointed by it. <br>
Only then do they start to care about their grade!

They suddenly feel very diligent and spring into action! _"Mr. Parish, is there any extre credit work I can do in the next day or two to help me get a higher grade? Please! Please! I need a higher grade! If I don't get one, something horribile will happen to me!"_

I absoloutely hate this type of behavior. It is the worst that a young adult university student can exhabit.

Not only is this childish, but it's rather offensive considering the amount of work most students _and_ I put into this course. I give you many chances to choose your homework assignments, and I am available many hours per day to help you with your questions. Suddenly, after a hard semester of long work, you want me to give you an assignment and grade it really quickly at one of the times of the year that I'm busiest? How rude!

In addition, it would be quite unethical for me to give you such a chance without offering it to all of the other students in the class. Do you think I want to grade 10 or 20 extra credit projects on the last day of final grades? Nope!

If you ask me to do this at the end of the semester, I will simply email you this page.

Please, keep me informed of your troubles in this class, ask questions, and help us solve problems early!
